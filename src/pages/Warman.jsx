                            The Warman Challenge is a competition held yearly by Weir Minerals Australia
                            Ltd. The participants (mostly second-year engineering students) will have to
                            find practical solutions to theoretical problems. For the 2024 challenge, we are
                            tasked with designing and building a robot to collect 6 balls located at
                            different positions and heights. After that, the collected balls will be deposited
                            into a hole on the track within 120 seconds. The final design must adhere
                            strictly to the competition rules, otherwise, the team could be disqualified.

                            We have remodelled the track in Solidwork for robot's simulation purpose, also it made scaling the size
                            of components more easy. There is a tree (tall pole) and 2 tennis balls (seed pods) being placed on each 
                            side of the track.  In the middle, a hole (the incinerator) is made for the robot to drop the payload into.

                            Every team can have a maximum of 5 members. Our team had a combination of mechanical and mechatronics 
                            expertise, whose skills could cover most aspects of robotic design. In this project, I took responsibility as
                            the team lead, and also designed the ball catcher components and single-handedly developed the control software.

                            The robot, which we named "Cat Bot" was equipped with 2 large brushes, driven by 2 geared NEMA17s, to ensure the ball could be picked up even when the robotâ€™s alignment 
                            with the ball was not ideal, providing high tolerance against positional errors. For localisation, the flatness of the Warman track provided an excellent working 
                            surface for an optical mouse, which gave precise x and y offsets of the robot by accumulating the small offsets over time. For navigation, the holonomic 
                            drive configuration (4 NEMA17s & 4 omni-directional wheels) was implemented, which allowed the robot to move horizontally 
                            without having to turn its chassis. A 3d-printed, lightweight electronics housing is mounted on the ball catcher to
                            keep the cables neat, minimising the risk of unwanted disconnection.
