                            The Warman Challenge is a competition held yearly by Weir Minerals Australia
                            Ltd. The participants (mostly second-year engineering students) will have to
                            find practical solutions to theoretical problems. For the 2024 challenge, we are
                            tasked with designing and building a robot to collect 6 balls located at
                            different positions and heights. After that, the collected balls will be deposited
                            into a hole on the track within 120 seconds. The final design must adhere
                            strictly to the competition rules, otherwise, the team could be disqualified. 

                            <Figure src="/warman/track.png" alt="setup" caption="Figure 1.1. Warman 2024 track"/> <br/> 

                            We have remodelled the track in Solidwork for robot's simulation purpose, also it made scaling the size
                            of components more easy. There is a tree (tall pole) and 2 tennis balls (seed pods) being placed on each 
                            side of the track.  In the middle, a hole (the incinerator) is made for the robot to drop the payload into.
                            Check out the interactive track below!

                            Every team can have a maximum of 5 members. Our team had a combination of mechanical and mechatronics 
                            expertise, whose skills could cover most aspects of robotic design. In this project, I took responsibility as
                            the team lead, and also designed the ball catcher components and single-handedly developed the control software.

                            The robot, which we named "Cat Bot" was equipped with 2 large brushes, driven by 2 geared NEMA17s, to ensure the ball could be picked up even when the robotâ€™s alignment 
                            with the ball was not ideal, providing high tolerance against positional errors. For localisation, the flatness of the Warman track provided an excellent working 
                            surface for an optical mouse, which gave precise x and y offsets of the robot by accumulating the small offsets over time. For navigation, the holonomic 
                            drive configuration (4 NEMA17s & 4 omni-directional wheels) was implemented, which allowed the robot to move horizontally 
                            without having to turn its chassis. A 3d-printed, lightweight electronics housing is mounted on the ball catcher to
                            keep the cables neat, minimising the risk of unwanted disconnection.

                            To store the balls after being collected, we decided to use a funnel-like design so that the balls could be 
                            effortlessly released when needed. Also, it can interface with the pick-up mechanism with no moving parts. 

                            <Figure src="/warman/catcher.png" alt="setup" caption="Figure 3.1. The catcher used in demonstration"/> <br/> 

                            The catcher is the sole storage unit of the robot. The ball-guiding slope is surrounded by high walls so 
                            that balls cannot bounce back outside. Once inside, the balls will constantly drag on the ground until being 
                            deposited. This catcher will be mounted directly onto the chassis using M4 bolts. Plywood is selected to 
                            manufacture the catcher which could be laser cut to improve precision and reduce manufacturing time, 
                            then different sections could be assembled using customized 3D printed linkers. Laser cutting is chosen 
                            as it is less time-consuming than 3d-printing, and more cost-effective compared to CNC. <br/> 

                            <Figure src="/warman/mountedCatcher.png" alt="setup" caption="Figure 3.2. The catcher mounted onto chassis"/> <br/> 

                            During the prototyping stage, we made a cardboard version of our robot to have a rough idea about the scale 
                            of each mechanical components when put together. It helped us realise the ball-congestion issue in the early catcher design,
                            as the catcher is too narrow to store all 6 balls. Comparing the final version to the early one, you can notice 
                            the end point has been widened considerably.

                            <Figure src="/warman/earlyCatcher.png" alt="setup" caption="Figure 3.3. Early catcher design"/> 
                            <br/>
                            As a lot of adjustments were made during the development of the catcher, I have come up with a series of equations
                            to parametrically model the catcher, allowing for quick updates if any dimensions need to be modified. We can 
                            dynamically calculate the length of edge L and the angle of linkers (<InlineMath math='\beta'/> and <InlineMath math='\gamma'/>) as follow: 
                            <br/>
                            
                            <Figure src="/warman/catcherEquation.png" alt="setup" caption="Figure 3.4. Catcher Equations" width='w-100'/> <br/> 
                            <InlineMath math='L = \sqrt{(\frac{x-length(end)}{2} - \cos(\alpha))^2 + (x-y-\sin(\alpha))^2}\ \mathrm{mm}'/> <br/> <br/>
                            <InlineMath math='\beta = 360^\circ - \arcsin(\frac{x-y-\sin(\alpha)}{L})'/> <br/> <br/>
                            <InlineMath math='\gamma = \beta + \alpha'/> <br/> <br/>

                            Note that we need to predefine <InlineMath math='s'/> and <InlineMath math='length(end)'/>, which is the length of the backplate, and angle <InlineMath math='\alpha'/>.
                            The dimenstion of the broom platform (<InlineMath math='x'/> and <InlineMath math='y'/>) should also be known beforehand.
                            Furthermore, the point marked with a red dot is a fixed point.

                                    To drive all 4 stepper motors (NEMA 17), we use the DRV8825 stepper driver, which is rated for 1.5A per coil 
                                    without using any cooling method, and up to 2.2A with sufficient cooling. The breakout board provides a 
                                    potentiometer that could be used to adjust the current limit to match the applicationâ€™s needs.

                            The following formula shows the relationship between the reference voltage (voltage between the potentiometer 
                            and ground) and the current limit of DRV8825: 
                            <BlockMath math='I_{limit} = 2V_{REF}'/>
                            As we want to keep the driverâ€™s temperature nominal to avoid a sudden malfunction, a current limit of 1A is 
                            chosen, mapping to a <InlineMath math='V_{REF}'/> value of 500mV.
                            <Figure src="/warman/drvpinout.png" alt="setup" caption="Figure 4.1. DRV8825 breaout board pin-out" width='w-60'/> <br/> 
                            To improve the precision of NEMA17, we can implement micro-stepping control. By pulling up pins M0 and M2, 
                            we increase the motorâ€™s step-per-revolution (normally 200) by a factor of 32. This results in smoother, 
                            quieter operation and more precise control due to the finer resolution of each step, allowing the motor to 
                            make smaller rotational changes. <br/> <br/>
                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-6">4.2. Dead-Reckoning</h3>
                            We will use dead-reckoning to perform the <InlineMath math='180^\circ'/> rotation as can be seen at the 0:55 mark
                            of our demonstration video above, as using a magnetometer to sense yaw requires precise calibration and shielding 
                            for it to function correctly, which is complicated and time-consuming. <br/><br/>

                                    To turn an angle <InlineMath math='\alpha'/>, first we will find the number of wheel revolutions needed:
                                    <BlockMath math='numRev = \frac{\pi d \frac{\alpha}{360}}{2\pi r_{wheel}}'/>
                                    The numerator is the arc length that the wheel has to travel to achieve <InlineMath math='\alpha'/> degree of rotation.

                            </div> <br/>
                            Then, we can derive the number of steps required by :

                            According to the Warman 2024 rules, it is allowed to position the robot anywhere on the track. Therefore, we choose 
                            the top left corner as the starting point with the robot facing the tennis ball, and sequentially reached 7 other goals (Figure 5.1).

                            There are 2 computing units on the robot - an Arduino Mega to drive the motor system consisting of 6 NEMA17s and 2 35kg servos, and 
                            an Arduino Nano to process sensor data (from the optical mouse and 2 limit switches) and keep track of the mission state. These limit
                            switches are used as a more reliable replacement for the magnetometer to fix yaw error. The robot simply needs to keep pushing 
                            forward until it crashes into the raised platform, that will engage both switches which indicate the robot is parallel to the platform, as
                            shown in the clip below. <br/><br/>
